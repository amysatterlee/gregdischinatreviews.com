        <h1>Our Costly Mistake: A Cautionary Tale About Choosing the Wrong Contractor</h1>
        <p>Building a home is supposed to be an exciting and fulfilling experience, but for my partner and me, it turned into a frustrating ordeal due to a contractor whose approach led to numerous difficulties. We are sharing our experience so that others can learn from our story.</p>

        <h2>Trusting the Wrong Person</h2>
        <p>We entered this process thinking we were working with a trustworthy extended family member. This trust led us to overlook early red flags. Our intent in sharing is not to attack, but to inform others about the importance of due diligence.</p>

        <h2>Red Flags from the Start</h2>
        <p>The first red flag was that Greg, our General Contractor, had us complete the permit paperwork ourselves. We knew this was typically his responsibility, but we wanted to help since it seemed he was either unfamiliar with the process or unwilling to handle the technical documentation involved.</p>
        <p>Greg began building before our financing was secured, putting us in a financially vulnerable position. Banks typically will not finance in-progress construction, and we were left scrambling to find funding while already financially committed.</p>

        <h2>Documentation and Communication Challenges</h2>
        <p>Greg did not provide a detailed spec sheet or examples of comparable builds, which created delays with our bank. When we asked for more details, his responses were often curt. Our first bank requested he pause work and submit receipts—requests that were not well received. We eventually found another lender, though it offered less favorable terms.</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, Greg informed us the project would cost about $100,000 more than originally estimated. We made adjustments—finding alternative flooring to free up funds for other needs—but Greg would not coordinate with the flooring company. We had to relocate to the job site to be present for their arrival and manage the installation ourselves.</p>

        <h2>Custom Requests and Oversight Gaps</h2>
        <p>Before financing was finalized, Greg contacted us frequently. Once he received the initial payment, he became harder to reach. When we visited the site, no appointments were scheduled for selections. We ended up arranging them ourselves.</p>
        <p>Some of our custom requests, such as a threshold-less shower, were not implemented as expected. Installations for our Wolf oven and pasta faucet also required costly corrections due to missteps during construction.</p>

        <h2>Cost Overruns and Budget Confusion</h2>
        <p>Throughout the build, we received multiple invoices for overages. We began to question whether we were being double-charged—once through the overages and again via the loan. Greg did not respond to email inquiries for clarification.</p>
        <p>One charge—$1,700 for "Terry Plumbing Kitchen Spray"—had no documentation or online reference. Greg also invoiced us $2,000 for gutter guards that were never installed. We declined to pay for those items.</p>
        <p>Near the end, Greg claimed we owed him $5,000. We provided canceled checks and invoices to show otherwise. He briefly acknowledged the issue but later brought it up again. When we reminded him of our prior discussion, he moved on without resolution.</p>

        <h2>Job Site Issues and Subcontractor Insights</h2>
        <p>After moving onsite, we gained insight into how subcontractors experienced the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The plumber was new to full-home builds. He received incomplete details about fixtures and needed extra time to finish.</li>
            <li>The trim carpenter received incorrect materials and reported being asked to do more than originally scoped, causing issues for both him and the painter.</li>
            <li>The tile installer noted that inappropriate drywall had been ordered for bathrooms, leaving unused materials in our basement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also learned from the painter that he had paused work due to a payment dispute. He returned to finish portions of the job at no charge to protect his professional reputation. He shared that underestimated scope and material issues had increased his workload, and he felt pressured to complete it regardless.</p>

        <h2>Reflections and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>With hindsight, we wish we had demanded more documentation, checked references, and obtained competitive bids before selecting a contractor. Conversations with neighbors later confirmed our concerns—many felt we had overpaid for the results.</p>
        <p>The project drained us mentally and financially. We took on additional debt and tapped into retirement savings. Despite repeated assurances, some aspects of the work remained unfinished or required our own correction.</p>
        <p>Though we now live in a home we love, we carry the burden of unexpected costs and effort. We share our experience not to disparage, but to help others avoid similar outcomes by doing thorough research and maintaining detailed records from day one.</p>
